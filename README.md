# Solving-Colebrook-Equation-with-Numerical-Methods
1.Writing a code solve Colebrook equation using • Newton Raphson method  • Secant method  2. Plot Moody diagram using data obtained from Newton-Raphson  method. 3.Compare convergence properties of Newton Raphson and secant  method for same initial guess. Plot error vs iteration count, if  necessary, in log scale.

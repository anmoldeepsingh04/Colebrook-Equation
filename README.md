# Solving-Colebrook-Equation-with-Numerical-Methods
1.Writing a code solve Colebrook equation using:
• Newton Raphson method  • Secant method  
2.Plot Moody diagram using data obtained from Newton-Raphson method
3.Compare convergence properties of Newton Raphson and Secant  method for same initial guess. 
4.Plot error vs iteration count.
